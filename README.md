Stuff to do during this summer

### StackOverflow profile

Build your StackOverflow profile. It's a great way to get noticed by employers. The higher your reputation, the higher your chances of getting noticed

### Hackerrank

Work on your programming skills with Hackerrank. It's gonna help you a lot! Many employers use Hackerrank now to conduct technical interviews. Domains you should definitely look at: Data Structures, Algorithms, Security etc.

### Web development

Get some web dev experience. Doesn't matter what platform you're into (mobile,web,VR,embedded etc), you'll encounter web technologies, period! You don't have to be a wiz, Just some basic understanding of HTML,CSS, and JS will do. Of course, you can go beyond that. The reason I'm saying this is because it's REALLY easy to get started with web dev and it's very likely that you'll end up having to build a web app at a hackathon. Plus 90% of jobs out there require SOME web experience if not a lot. There are plenty of resources out there but I'll be posting a list of web dev resources here soon!

### Version control

Get really good with using Git. I am planning on getting us started with contributing to open source projects next semester.
